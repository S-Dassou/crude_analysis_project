    "- In this notebook we analyse Vortexa's crude oil floating storage data (retrieved using our Python SDK) and its relationship to crude oil prices. Floating storage is directly determined by oil prices and market dynamics; however, it is not known whether floating storage may be predictive of oil prices in the future. In other words, can floating storage be used as a trading signal for crude oil? Here we apply Granger causality analysis on floating storage and price data, and for the first time demonstrate that floating storage may have significant predictive value for spot crude oil prices 2-3 months into the future."
